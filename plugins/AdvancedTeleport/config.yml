# Please refer to https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Commands.yml for this!

#  Warm-Up Timers  #

#  Cooldowns  #
###############

# How long before the user can use a command again.
# This stops users spamming commands repeatedly.
# This is also the default cooldown period for all commands.

add-cooldown-duration-to-warm-up: true

# Whether or not the cooldown of one command will stop a user from using all commands.
# For example, if a player used /tpa with a cooldown of 10 seconds but then used /tpahere with a cooldown of 5, the 10-second cooldown would still apply.
# On the other hand, if a player used /tpahere, the cooldown of 5 seconds would apply to /tpa and other commands.
apply-cooldown-to-all-commands: true

# When to apply the cooldown
# Options include:
# - request - Cooldown starts as soon as any teleport command is made and still applies even if no teleport takes place (i.e. cancelled by movement or not accepted).
# - accept - Cooldown starts only when the teleport request is accepted (with /tpyes) and still applies even if no teleport takes place (i.e. cancelled by movement).
# - teleport - Cooldown starts only when the teleport actually happens.
# Note:
# 'request' and 'accept' behave the same for /rtp, /back, /spawn, /warp, and /home
# cooldown for /tpall always starts when the command is ran, regardless if any player accepts or teleports

# WARNING: A lot of the options below are considered advanced and use special syntax that is not often accepted in YAML.

# The teleportation rules defined for each world.
# Rules include:
# - stop-teleportation-out - Stops players teleporting to another world when they are in this world.
# - stop-teleportation-within - Stops players teleporting within the world.
# - stop-teleportation-into - Stops players teleporting into this world.
# To combine multiple rules, use a ; - e.g. stop-teleportation-out;stop-teleportation-within
# For out and into rules, you can make it so that rules only initiate when in or going to a specific world using :, e.g. stop-teleportation-out:world stops players teleporting to "world" in the world they're currently in.
# To do the opposite (i.e. initiates the rule when users are not in the specified world), use !, e.g. stop-teleportation-into!world stops teleportation into a specific world if they are not in "world". If ! and : are used in the same rule, then : is given top priority.To make this rule work with multiple worlds, use a comma (,), e.g. stop-teleportation-into:world,world_nether

# The teleportation rules defined for each AT command.
# Rules include:
# - override - The command will override world rules and run regardless.
# - ignore - The command will refuse to run regardless of world rules.
# To combine multiple rules, use a ;.
# To make rules behave differently in different worlds, use : to initiate the rule in a specific world (e.g. override:world to make the command override "world"'s rules.)
# To initiate rules outside of a specific world, use ! (e.g. override!world to make the command override world rules everywhere but in world)
# To use multiple worlds, use a comma (,).
# By default, all commands will comply with the world rules. If no rules are specified, they will comply.
# All worlds specified will be considered the world in which the player is currently in. For worlds being teleported to, add > to the start of the world name.
# For example, ignore:world,>world_nether will not run if the player is in "world" or if the player is going into the Nether.

# - anchor - 1.16+ only, teleports to the player's respawn anchor. However, due to limitations with Spigot's API, it may or may not always work. (add Player#getRespawnAnchor pls)
# - warp:Warp Name - Teleports the player to a specified warp. For example, if you want to teleport to Hub, you'd type warp:Hub
# - {default} - Uses the default respawn option, which is spawn unless set differently.
# If you're using EssentialsX Spawn and want AT to take over respawn mechanics, set respawn-listener-priority in EssX's config.yml file to lowest.

#  Permissions  #
#################

# The default permissions given to users without OP.

# However, if you have a permissions plugin and Vault installed, you cannot make admin permissions work by default.
default-permissions:
- at.member.*
- at.member.warp.*

# Allows admin permissions to be allowed as default permissions by default.
# If you want to use admin permissions, it's often recommended to use a permissions plugin such as LuckPerms.
# Do not enable this if you are unsure of the risks this option proposes.
