# ======================= IMPORTANT =============================
# Don't change any configurations if you do not know what it does
# If you have any questions, message developer on discord, usually a problem can be
# fixed in a matter of seconds
# main.yml is the anti-cheats configuration file! Not copy.yml if you have one! This is just incase if you deleted the main.yml with some commands, this file is not
# directly used by the anti-cheat in any way!
# Restarting/reloading/ using the command /sacreload may be prefferable to /sacconfigset 
# [sacconfigset command delete most comments of the main.yml file and should only be used in emergencies or you know what you are doing]
# ===============================================================
# 
# =========================================================================
# The meaning "How long or the amount" is 2 PacketPlayInFlying as 1 in this configuration
# Any config that has the name "timer" is 20 = 1 second
# The numbers in GUI ban is by hours so 1 = 60 minutes
# The speed variables of this file is the players "to" position and the "from" position, calculating the distance and multiplying it by 10
# =========================================================================
# IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN EDITING ANY NON-COMBAT VALUES | THE MEANING "untilFlagging" means CONSISTENT FLAGGING, not STUTTERING FLAGS
# IF IT STUTTERS THEN IT WILL RESET THE FLAG COUNTER AND NOT FLAG THE PLAYER 
# MANY OF THOSE VALUES ARE SET TO STOP FALSES FROM OCCURING, meaning if you set one of those variables too high
# it will certainly not flag the player | THE ENTIRE ANTI-CHEAT RUNS OFF THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM
# =========================================================================
# This is a variable you do not touch, this variable is set when multiple new configurations are out
# If you change this Interger in any way it will delete main.yml and generate a new one
# Unless the number is equal to the new numbers version, for example if you've changed a lot of configuration
# Delete copy.yml and copy any new configuration
